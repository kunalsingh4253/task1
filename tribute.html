        <h1 class="tribute-apj">About the legend</h1>
        <p>
          &#9755; Cristiano Ronaldo was born in Funchal, Portugal, on 5th
          February <b>1985</b>. <br /><br />
          &#9755;He is <b> 6′ 1″</b> tall (<b>1.86</b> metres). <br /><br />
          &#9755; His full name is Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755;He has played for several different football clubs, including
          Andorinha (Portugal), Nacional (Portugal), Sporting CP (Portugal),
          Manchester United (England), Real Madrid (Spain), and Juventus
          (Italy). <br />
          <br />
          &#9755;From <b>2009-2013</b>, Ronaldo averaged more than <b>1</b> goal
          per game, making him one of the most prolific goalscorers to ever play
          the game. <br /><br />
          &#9755;Ronaldo made his international debut in <b>2003</b>, and he
          scored his first goal for Portugal in 2004 against Greece. He has
          since scored more than <b>100</b> goals for his country, and in
          <b>2021</b> he broke the international goalscoring recor. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755;Ronaldo was reluctant to wear the number <b>2009-2013</b> shirt
          when he joined Manchester United because it had previously been worn
          by great players such as George Best,<strong> Eric Cantona</strong>,
          and <strong>David Beckham</strong>. Alex Ferguson convinced him to
          make the number his own. Ronaldo also wore the number <b>7</b> shirt
          for Real Madrid and Portugal. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755;Ronaldo has won many individual and team honours. He is often
          described as an all-time great player and, had he not been playing in
          the same era as Lionel Messi, he would be a unanimous choice of the
          best player of his generation. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755; Ronaldo is a brilliant dribbler, is incredibly fast and he has
          great reactions and coordination. He doesn’t have any weaknesses in
          terms of his forward play. He can score with both feet, is a very good
          header of the ball. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755;In August <b>2021</b>, Ronaldo returned to Manchester United
          from Juventus. Ronaldo has scored more than <b>130</b> goals in the
          Champions League during his career. Ronaldo’s son, Cris, joined the
          Manchester United academy at the age of <b>11</b>,. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755;Ronaldo does not drink any alcohol. When he was growing up he
          had two nicknames: Little Bee (because of his speed) and Cry Baby.
          Ronaldo was the first Portuguese player to play for Manchester United.
          In <b>2001</b>, a one-of-a-kind Ronaldo NFT football trading card
          (minted by the soccer game company Sorare) sold at a Bonhams auction
          for more than <b>$400,000</b>. <br /><br />
          &#9755;At the age of <b>12</b>, Ronaldo caught the attention of
          Sporting Lisbon, one of Portugal’s most renowned football clubs. We
          examine his time at the club’s youth academy, where he honed his
          skills and showcased immense potential. Ronaldo’s rise through the
          ranks led to his first-team debut at the age of <b>17</b>, setting the
          stage for his meteoric ascent.. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755; Ronaldo’s transfer to Manchester United in 2003 marked a
          defining moment in his career. We delve into his early years at the
          club under the tutelage of Sir Alex Ferguson, where he evolved into a
          true superstar.. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755; In <b>2009</b>, Ronaldo made a high-profile move to Real
          Madrid, becoming the world’s most expensive player at the time. We
          explore his nine incredible seasons with Los Blancos, during which he
          shattered numerous records, including becoming the club’s all-time
          leading scorer. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755; The next chapter of Ronaldo’s career saw him join Juventus in
          <b>2018</b>, bringing his unique blend of skill, leadership, and
          winning mentality to the Italian Serie A. We discuss his impact on the
          team, his pursuit of domestic glory, and his unwavering commitment to
          excellence.<br />
          <br />
          &#9755;We highlight his success in international competitions,
          including winning the UEFA European Championship in <b>2016</b>.
          Additionally, we delve into the numerous individual accolades Ronaldo
          has amassed throughout his career, including multiple FIFA Ballon d’Or
          awards. <br />
          <br />
          &#9755; As Ronaldo continues to dazzle audiences with his exceptional
          skills, his impact on the sport and its future generations cannot be
          overstated. We reflect on his enduring legacy as a role model for
          aspiring players, his influence on the development of modern football,
          and his ability to inspire millions around the world through his
          dedication, work ethic, and relentless pursuit of success.<br />
